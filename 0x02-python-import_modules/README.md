  Foundations - Higher-level programming â€• Python

## 0-add.py   | 0. Import a simple function from a simple file |
  Write a program that imports the function def add(a, b): from the file add_0.py and prints the result of the addition 1 + 2 = 3
  * You have to use print function with string format to display integers
  * You have to assign:
  + the value 1 to a variable called a
  + the value 2 to a variable called b
  * and use those two variables as arguments when calling the functions add and print
  * a and b must be defined in 2 different lines: a = 1 and another b = 2
  * Your program should print: <a value> + <b value> = <add(a, b) value> followed with a new line
  * You can only use the word add_0 once in your code
  * You are not allowed to use * for importing or __import__
  * Your code should not be executed when imported - by using __import__,
  > ./0-add.py
  > python3 0-import_add.py
     
## 1-calculation.py  | 1. My first toolbox! |
  Write a program that imports functions from the file calculator_1.py, does some Maths, and prints the result.
  * Do not use the function print (with string format to display integers) more than 4 times
  * You have to define:
   + the value 10 to a variable a
   + the value 5 to a variable b
  * and use those two variables only, as arguments when calling functions (including print)
  * a and b must be defined in 2 different lines: a = 10 and another b = 5
  * Your program should call each of the imported functions. See example below for format
  * the word calculator_1 should be used only once in your file
  * You are not allowed to use * for importing or __import__
  * Your code should not be executed when imported
  > ./1-calculation.py
  
## 2-args.py   | 2. How to make a script dynamic! |
  Write a program that prints the number of and the list of its arguments.
  * The output should be:
   + Number of argument(s) followed by argument (if number is one) or arguments (otherwise), followed by
   + : (or . if no arguments were passed) followed by
   + a new line, followed by (if at least one argument),one line per argument:
   + the position of the argument (starting at 1) followed by :, followed by the argument value and a new line
  * Your code should not be executed when imported
  * The number of elements of argv can be retrieved by using: len(argv)
  * You do not have to fully understand lists yet, but imagine that argv can be used just like a C array: you can use an index to walk through it. There are other ways (which will be preferred for future project tasks), if you know them you can use them.
  > ./2-args.py Hello Holberton School 98 Battery street
  
## 3-infinite_add.py  | 3. Infinite addition |
  Write a program that prints the result of the addition of all arguments
  * The output should be the result of the addition of all arguments, followed by a new line
  * You can cast arguments into integers by using int() (you can assume that all arguments can be casted into integers)
  * Your code should not be executed when imported
  * Last but not least, your program should also handle big numbers. 
  > ./3-infinite_add.py 79 10 -40 -300 89
  
## 4-hidden_discovery.py   | 4. Who are you? |
  Write a program that prints all the names defined by the compiled module hidden_4.pyc (please download it locally).
  * You should print one name per line, in alpha order
  * You should print only names that do not start with __
  * Your code should not be executed when imported
  * Make sure you are running your code in Python3.4.x (hidden_4.pyc has been compiled with this version)
  > curl -Lso "hidden_4.pyc" "https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x02.py/raw/master/hidden_4.pyc"
  > ./4-hidden_discovery.py | sort
 
## 5-variable_load.py   | 5. Everything can be imported |
  Write a program that imports the variable a from the file variable_load_5.py and prints its value.
  * You are not allowed to use * for importing or __import__
  * Your code should not be executed when imported
  > ./5-variable_load.py

## 100-my_calculator.py  | 6. Build my own calculator! |
  Write a program that imports all functions from the file calculator_1.py and handles basic operations.
  * Usage: ./100-my_calculator.py a operator b
   + If the number of arguments is not 3, your program has to:
   + print Usage: ./100-my_calculator.py <a> <operator> <b> followed with a new line
   + exit with the value 1
   + operator can be: + for addition  - for subtraction  * for multiplication  / for division
   + If the operator is not one of the above:
   + print Unknown operator. Available operators: +, -, * and / followed with a new line
   + exit with the value 1
   + You can cast a and b into integers by using int() (you can assume that all arguments will be castable into integers)
   + The result should be printed like this: <a> <operator> <b> = <result>, followed by a new line
  * You are not allowed to use * for importing or __import__
  * Your code should not be executed when imported
  > ../100-my_calculator.py 3 + 5 ; echo $?


## 101-easy_print.py   | 7. Easy print |
  Write a program that prints #pythoniscool, followed by a new line, in the standard output.
  * Your program should be maximum 2 lines long
  * You are not allowed to use print or eval or open or import sys in your file 101-easy_print.py
  > ./101-easy_print.py

## 102-magic_calculation.py   | 8. ByteCode -> Python #3 |
  Write the Python function def magic_calculation(a, b): that does exactly the same as the following Python bytecode:
